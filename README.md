[Diplomacy][1] is a [Risk][2]-like board game with a strong Internet fan base. Many browser-based clients exist, but none have quite the flexibility of the play-by-email servers they intended to replace. This online Diplomacy project seeks to be as full-featured as possible and take full advantage of the modern web browser's abilities.  This project is written using a HTML5 and AngularJS front end and an ExpressJS back end.

# Goals
1. The development process will be fully transparent. Custom map and ruleset creation should be simple but flexible.
2. The user interface will be interactive and fun.
3. The project will bring together the best characteristics of previous Diplomacy implementations.
4. The project will be fully unit-tested. (This is for my own good and reparations against many years of crimes against testability.)

# Installation

At this early stage the kinks that prevent a smooth cloning process are still being worked out. The database needs scripting and incorporation into GitHub, and there is at least one file dedicated to sensitive information I can't include.

If that doesn't stop you, clone this repository, run `npm install` inside the directory, then `grunt serve`.

More to come!
